# polling2

_Never write another polling function again!_

Documentation available at [Read the Docs](https://polling2.readthedocs.io)

You can install the package from [Pypi](https://pypi.org/project/polling2/)

Polling2 is a powerful python utility used to wait for a function to return a certain expected condition.

Some possible uses cases include:

- Wait for API response to return with code 200
- Wait for a file to exist (or not exist)
- Wait for a thread lock on a resource to expire

Polling2 is handy for getting rid of all that duplicated polling-code. Often, applications require retrying until the correct response is returned. Why re-implement the ability to poll again and again? Use Polling2!

Polling2 is a fork of the original [polling](https://github.com/justiniso/polling). It was forked when the original maintainer failed to respond to issues or PRs. 

Polling2 is _under active development_. Would you like to see a particular feature? Ask and thou shall recieve.

## Installation

```
pip install polling2
```

## Development installation

```shell
# install lib, but use system links from the repo into sitepackages.
python setup.py develop
# install test dependenices.
python setup.py test
# run the tests
pytest tests
```

## Example:

```python
# This call will wait until the file exists, checking every 0.1 seconds and stopping after 3 seconds have elapsed
file_handle = polling2.poll(
    lambda: open('/tmp/myfile.txt'),
    ignore_exceptions=(IOError,),
    timeout=3,
    step=0.1)

# Polling will return the value of your polling function, so you can now interact with it
file_handle.close()
```

There are [more examples](https://polling2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/examples) in the documentation.
